(##) A2L1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:
**1) case 1: e->on_boundary() is true, then return nullopt;**

**2) case 2: if e is not a boundary edge, h->face and h->twin->face should be co-plane(expect for both face are triangle). If not, return nullopt;**

**3) case 3: general valid operation case.**

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l1.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L2 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:
**1) case1: e->on_boundary() is ture, i.e. edge is a boundary edge;**

**2) case2: e->on_boundary() is false, i.e. edge is not a boundary edge;**

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l2.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L3 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:
**1) case1: the mesh is a simple triangle, return nullopt;**

**2) case2: the mesh is a three pyramid, return nullopt (prevent converting from 3D mesh to 2D mesh);**

**3) case3: if edge e is the only edge separating two faces, collapsed edge operation will destory connectivity;**

**3.1) case3.1: if e->h->face and e->h->twin->face are triangle, the conectivity of these two triangle should be 3, otherwise return nullopt;**

**4) case4: general valid collapse operation case;**

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l3.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L4 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l4.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) CREATED MODEL FINAL

Image of model in the GUI:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A2-writeup/student/my_tank.png" alt="my_tank">
</div>
Explanation of what it is and how you made it:

**It is a tank model, I create 3 mesh instances and take some local and global operations: move, scale, catmull, triangulate, remesh. 
Then combine all this components together.**

Any free model sources you need to credit?
